### buffer_app

`buffer_app` is a quick GUI (Tkinter or Qt) to quickly calculate recipes for stock buffer dilution and adjustment.

See [buffer_app README](/scripts/buffer_app) for details.

### mol2scad

`mol2scad` is a script to turn molecular coordinates into SCAD files.  Takes molfile / sdf coordinates as input, outputs a scad file for OpenSCAD.

See [mol2scad README](/scripts/mol2scad) for details.

### dashmichaelis

`dashmichaelis` is a Dash webapp for regression fitting of enzyme kinetics data to a Michaelis-Menten model.

See [dash_michaelis README](/scripts/dash_michaelis) for details.

### dashbuffers

`dash_buffers` is a Dash webapp for biochemical buffer adjustment.

See [dash_buffers README](/scripts/dash_buffers) for details.
