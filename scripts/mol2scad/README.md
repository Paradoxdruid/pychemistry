# mol2scad

**mol2scad** is a script to turn molecular coordinates into SCAD files.  Takes molfile / sdf coordinates as input, outputs a scad file for OpenSCAD.

## Usage

```
python mol2scad.py -i <input molfile> -o <output scadfile>
```

A useful tool to [obtain mol files](https://cccbdb.nist.gov/mdlmol1.asp) is available via NIST.
